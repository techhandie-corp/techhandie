#Ignored files are usually platform-specific files or automatically created files from the build systems. #Some common examples include:
#
#   Runtime files such as log, lock, cache, or temporary files.
#   Files with sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys.
#   Compiled code, such as .class or .o.
#   Dependency directories, such as /vendor or /node_modules .
#   Build directories, such as /public, /out, or /dist.
#   System files like .DS_Store or Thumbs.db
#   IDE or text editor configuration files.
